"""Alexa custom skill endpoint, so Echo devices can talk to the agent.

An Echo cannot be an Assist satellite: skills get no access to the microphone.
What a custom skill does give us is the recognised text, which is all the
conversation agent needs. Alexa keeps the wake word, the speech recognition and
the voice; Home Assistant keeps the house.

The catch is time. Alexa allows a skill about 8 seconds to return a full
response, so a slow turn cannot simply be waited out. Answers that arrive in
time are spoken as the response; the rest are announced on the Echo that asked,
once they are ready. Nothing is spoken in between: the wait stays silent rather
than filled, so the first thing the Echo says is the answer.
